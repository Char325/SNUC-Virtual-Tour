# SNUCTour 3D Web Application

In this project we have created a site for SNUC in order to be able to give a tour of the campus

This is built on the problem statement that not everyone can come for a campus tour
especially if they are very far away from that campus.

This web application solves that by giving a virtual tour and a satellite view of the campus:

1) We have given functionalities of doing the tour via Panoraven to show the 3D image of the campus to tour around it

2) There is a gallery view for looking at the scenic beauty of the campus

3) There is also a satellite view linked to the google maps in order to give directions to the campus or for people to see the satellite view of the campus

## Precautions
